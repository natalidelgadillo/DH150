# DH150 Assignment02: Usability Testing by Natali Delgadillo

## Introduction

Naked Wines is a wine box subscription service that allows you to try new wines every month. The website offers wines of every kind and every price. There is a $100 voucher offered when the user tries the service for the first time. Users are allowed to buy prepackaged boxes or can add wines that they desire to their customized box. Naked Wines is unique because it connects buyers directly to the winemakers with direct reviews and the option to browse through winemaker profiles.
This service has proven successful due to their affordability, accessibility, and quality. Users enjoy getting their wine delivered to their front door monthly, instead of spending time at their local wine shop.

## Purpose of Usability Testing

The purpose of a usability test (UT) is to identify and fix any usability issues that a user may encounter. It is essential to ensure that a user can use and navigate a website, application, or product.
UT allows the designers to identify issues from a heuristic evaluation that may be fixed to improve the user experience. By directly identifying the challenges a user may experience during a recorded session, the correction process is made much simpler. The insights and perspectives recorded during a test may facilitate future product design and error prevention.


## Methodology 

The UT assessed three metrics of usability: effectiveness, satisfaction, and efficiency. I recruited my roommate who is of age and enjoys drinking wine very much. We were able to conduct the test in my apartment, in separate quiet rooms. The entire testing process took about 25 minutes.
For the test, I inserted a pre-test questionnaire that measured the user's initial perception of the Naked Wines website. 
After the pre-test, I walked the user through three tasks that required their exploration and interactions with the Naked Wines website. After the user completed the tasks, a post-test questionnaire measured their experience navigating the website. It surveyed their experience, ease with navigation, and personal likelihood of repeating a task. The SUS, or System Usability Scale, followed the post-test questionnaire.
The SUS determined the user's perception of the website and it's level of usability. Once completing the SUS, the Product Satisfaction Cards were presented to the user. 
These cards allowed the user to put their feelings and experiences into 5 different adjectives.


Heuristic Being Tested with Task | Usability Problem
------------ | -------------
Task 1: Recognition rather than Recall/ User searched for wine made by the same winemaker | Difficult for user to remember winemaker if searching for more wines by the same maker. The user must scroll around for a long amount of time before encountering a page or filter showing the same winemaker.
Task 2: Flexibility and Efficiency of use/ User explored website to locate wines with certain ratings. | Many problems encountered with the ratings of the wines. User could not easily locate them, there was no overall ratings, and the highest rated wines did not have any actual reviews. 
Task 3: Aesthetic and Design/ User browsed the website looking for certain items | User could not find many things, was unhappy with an email being required to navigate the website, stated that the website was too busy, and was often confused by the redundant features.


## Process of the Usability Test:

For the UT, I utilized the "record" feature of zoom on two different laptops. I wanted to include both my face and my user's face in the video, thus I used zoom. 
The usability test is intended as a pilot test.

## Reflection

  During this pilot test, I learned that the process is not as easy as it seems. Not only was it difficult to remain neutral as a moderator, but it was also a challenge to not verbally express thoughts I was having throughout the process. As I was surveying a friend, it was difficult to be completely serious and neutral. My user was somewhat nervous and would ask many questions that I was not allowed to answer. However, I did find myself using various neutral phrases from last week's lecture-- such as "there is no wrong answer" or "please do what you can to your own ability". I felt as though I learned many new things that could be improved that I had not noticed before. My user pointed out various flaws and features that confused her, making me reevaluate the issues I personally believed were most important. I really enjoyed having a second perspective on a website I observed so carefully the week prior for our first assignment, it validated my opinions while making me open to discovering new ones. I also found myself jotting down notes to reanalyze the website again with her perspective in mind.
 
 
  In the future, I want to improve my UT by making my tasks more concise and perhaps enjoyable. I also want to improve my skills as a moderator because I was not completely confident in my skills. As most things went well, I also wish I could improve a few things. I stumbled upon a few words while reading to my participant and found one or two typos I made on the survey. I hope that in my next UT, I will be better trained and more conscious of the mistakes I made this round. As much as it was a difficult task, I did learn about the effort and skills needed to conduct a successful UT. The feedback I collected will allow me to improve my future sessions and my future designs. Overall, I really enjoyed the process and am looking forward to moving on to our next project.
